Introduction
------------

openDCM is a extensible template only library for geometric constraint solving. Still in pre-alpha development and therefore unusable up to now.


Install and Requirements
------------------------

Installation is not nessecary as openDCM is a template only library. To include it successfull in your project you need the Eigen3 and Boost libraries. 
There exists a test suit for unit testing the hole library. If you wish to compile and execute these tests you should run cmake with the top level CMakeLists.txt. The resulting executable is the test programm which you only must execute.

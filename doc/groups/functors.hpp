/**@defgroup Metafunctions
 *
 *@brief A collection of useful metafunctions 
 * 
 * As extensible header-only library openDCM relies heavily on templates and template metaprograming. To ease the programming and 
 * reduce the syntax helper classes are introduced. Note that not all of them are metafunctions, some are pure help structs. They are grouped * under this tag as they all surf the same purpose.

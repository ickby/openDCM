/**@defgroup Functors
 *
 *@brief All functors used in openDCM
 * 
 * Functors are a very useful way of encapsuling functionality and therefore making code cleaner. They are also heavily used in boost::fusion
 * and alone from this point a vital part in openDCM. Note that functor functionality can often be replaced by boost::phoenix expressions, * * which is done on numerous places.
